To install DICE on macOS, follow these steps:

---

### 1. Install Required Dependencies

DICE requires the following software:

* CMake
* GSL (GNU Scientific Library)
* FFTW3 (Fastest Fourier Transform in the West)([GitHub][1])

You can install these using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install cmake gsl fftw
```

Alternatively, to install GSL and FFTW locally (recommended for cluster environments):

```bash
cd ~
mkdir local
cd local
```

Download and install GSL:

```bash
wget http://mirror.switch.ch/ftp/mirror/gnu/gsl/gsl-2.2.1.tar.gz
tar -xzf gsl-2.2.1.tar.gz
cd gsl-2.2.1
./configure --prefix=$HOME/local --enable-shared
make
make install
cd ..
```

Download and install FFTW:

```bash
wget http://www.fftw.org/fftw-3.3.5.tar.gz
tar -xzf fftw-3.3.5.tar.gz
cd fftw-3.3.5
./configure --prefix=$HOME/local --enable-threads --enable-shared
make
make install
cd ..
```

Add the local bin directory to your PATH by adding the following line to your `.profile`:

```bash
export PATH=$HOME/local/bin:$PATH
```

---

### 2. Clone the DICE Repository

```bash
git clone https://bitbucket.org/vperret/dice
```

---

### 3. Build and Install DICE

```bash
cd dice
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
make install
```

By default, DICE is installed in `$HOME/local/dice`. To specify a different installation directory, use:

```bash
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/desired/path
```

If you installed GSL and FFTW in non-standard locations, specify their paths:

```bash
cmake .. -DGSL_PATH=/path/to/gsl -DFFTW3_PATH=/path/to/fftw3 -DFFTW3_THREADS_PATH=/path/to/fftw3_threads
```

To enable threading for performance improvements:

```bash
cmake .. -DENABLE_THREADS=ON
make
make install
```

---

### 4. Update Your PATH

Add the DICE binary directory to your PATH by adding the following line to your `.profile`:

```bash
export PATH=$HOME/local/bin:$PATH
```

---

### 5. Notes

* Ensure that your CMake version is 2.6 or newer:

```bash
  cmake --version
```

* If you encounter errors related to `_intel_fast_memset_`, it may indicate that FFTW was compiled with the Intel compiler. In this case, you will need the Intel compiler to compile DICE.

* For GCC 10 and newer, if you encounter multiple definition errors, add the `-fcommon` flag:

```bash
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-fcommon"
```
