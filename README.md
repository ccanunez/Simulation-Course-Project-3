# Simulation-Course-Project-3

This document outlines a project that simulates galaxy interactions using an N-body Treecode, specifically the “gf” code, which is more efficient than standard methods for handling large numbers of particles. The first section focuses on constructing an isolated disk galaxy model using a tool called DICE. DICE combines components such as dark matter halos, disks, and bulges with specific density profiles. The model is then analyzed to determine its stability. The second section involves running this isolated galaxy simulation using the “gf” code and testing its stability. The third section of the project delves into simulating the formation of a collisional ring galaxy. This involves modeling the interaction between a disk galaxy and an elliptical galaxy and exploring how the collision’s parameters influence the resulting ring structure. Additionally, the document describes the necessary data handling steps, including converting between different binary and ASCII file formats used by the various software tools.
